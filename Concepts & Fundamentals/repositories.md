# REPOSITORIES

In programming, the term repository or repo is used over and over again. Repo is basically a 'folder'. It is important to also identify that there are not only 'local' repos, which are repos that live in your computer (think any new computer with a Downloads, Documents, Images repos). But there are also 'remote' repos, which are repositories that live on the internet. At the end of the day, a URL is the address for a remote repository, that you can access and it serves you files (html, javascript, css) that your computer translates and you visualize in the browser.

A definition I liked: 
Repos are simply just a http accessible location that you download files from.
