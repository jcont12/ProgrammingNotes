DYNAMICALLY VS STATICALLY TYPED LANGUAGES
In a statically typed language, all variable types are known at compile time. In this languages the developer must specify which type each variable is (java, C++).

The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

In a dynamic type language, the type checking is done at run time. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time

SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts (programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator). Examples include JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
