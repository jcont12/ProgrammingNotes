### Own it down mentality

As a manager you have to have an 'Own it down' mentality. Never what he/she/x said or decided. Its us as an organization have decided that, whether you like it or not.

Because of the above it is extra important to fight for what you think is the right way to do things. Otherwise things that you do NOT agree with are gonna happen and its gonna be harder to swallow them. Its easier if you at least get your point across and you understand WHY it won't be done the way you like it.

If this happens over and over again (things not being done the way you want them), then evaluate what the results are and check two things (have you been wrong/off on your opinnions? otherwise do you want to remain in an organization that keeps doing things the way you don't do them?)

As a manager, **DO NOT LET YOURSELF** get into the *'middle man'* position for an issue that should not be solved by you:
Your directs ask you for 'x' or 'y'?
* If it is within your power, then evaluate if it is the correct thing to do. If it is NOT the correct thing to do, make sure you give a STRONG explanation about why it didn't happen, and steps towards making it happen.
* If it is NOT something that is within your control/power, then facilitate the conversation between your direct and whomever is in charge, but *DO NOT* assume a responsibility that is not yours (I will look into it for you, I will try and get it done for you). Do however do all in your power that is WITHIN your scope of responsibility to help out.

Impatience, Proactiveness are great values to have (think Scott).

Your job is not to do things for your directs. It is to empower them and help them make the right decisions.

### Follow up

In your experience as a manager, follow up is perhaps the most important of responsibilities. It is of UTMOST importance that you have a defined owner for a task, that you follow up and get updates for the task, and that you empower your people to get those tasks done. Avoid micro-managing and trust in your directs.
