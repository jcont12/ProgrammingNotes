###SETTING UP PATH FOR SCRIPTS (https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux)
If there is a shell or script you want to run from anywhere without having to access its specific folder, go into your .bashrc file (usually in home folder) and add this : export PATH=pathtoshellscript/:$PATH
example: export PATH=/home/jorgecl/git/app-core/src/main/build/:$PATH
Make sure you restart the terminal, or type in source <filename> (source .bashrc)
NOW YOU CAN RUN THE SHELLSCRIPT files inside the folder  FROM ANYWHERE on your command line

###ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Once you have set your environment variable paths in your .bashrc file, you can directly navigate to where these files are using the $ symbol from anywhere in your command line. For example, run cd $JAVA_HOME and it will automatically take you to that folder

###CURL

###HOW TO RUN A PROGRAM DOWNLOADED AS A SHELL SCRIPT

###WHERE WAS A DOWNLOADED PACKAGE INSTALLED?

###HOW TO KILL A PROCESS THAT IS TAKING UP CPU
you can use the htop command to see the processes that are running.
The htop interface is self-explanatory... if you press F9 it gives you a list of "kill" signals to run on the process.... HOWEVER it was not working for me... probably because I need sudo access to send a kill signal and htop didn't allow this. 
So ryan used the ps -ef command followed by a grep with the process name to identify its PID (process id), and then ran a sudo kill -9 <PID> which sends a kill signal to the process directly.
