#Abstract classes  ["helpful link"](http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/faq/faq0084.html);

An abstract class is a class that contains abstract methods.

An abstract method is a method that is declared but has no implementation (no block of code to define how abstract method runs). 

This is because classes that extend from this abstract class all share the same method but each does it in a different way.

Therefore, an abstract class can't be instantiated, only subclasses extending from this abstract class can be instantiated and they must define in their own logic how the abstract method is implemented.
