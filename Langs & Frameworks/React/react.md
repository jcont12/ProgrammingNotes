DEBUGGING A JSX FILE
There are two optios for debugging a jsx file. The first is to add console.logs to the code, which will print output to the chrome dev tools console to see what you are trying to console.log.
The second is to actually find the file which won't be as straightforward as it is on your code. You can ususally find the JSX files under the Sources tab on chrome dev tools. under the javascript folder, one of the OC files. Select any of those files and click on the pretty print option (braces at the bottom of the shown file), and use Ctrl+F to find your way through that code to a specific method.

HOW TO ADD HARD CODE TO A OPSCON SECTION
Remember that any information you want to show has to be saved somewhere in the files state (React is all about passing props and keeping state).

HOW TO PASS THE RETURN OF A OPSJAVA FILE TO ITS CORRESPONDING JSX FILE
Through the Api.jsx file endpoints. Assign the endpoint that connects your jsx file to your opsresource file.
